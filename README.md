## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

This project was the first I tried using React composition. Personally, I liked how the App component divided everything at the end. It helped me extracting components and make the code cleaner. Finding what element I was looking for, was easier.

This was also the first time I used Sass' @each rule and maps effectively.

To the future, I pretend to look more into Hooks. All I needed in this project, was solved with useState and I can't help but think I should use something else, especially for the burger menu.
